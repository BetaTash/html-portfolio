<h1>The BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO NATASHA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h2>The book thief</h2>
<p>The book thief is a beautiful movie that shows a different side
    of the world war from a german perspective. It shows how Germans were also
    deeply affected by the war and hilters hatred of Jews and how they try to find peace, joy and love
    in the midst of chaos.
</p>
<h2>Twilight</h2>
<p>Twilight is just that movie</p>
<h2>Inception</h2>
<p>Inception is a great movie, the idea of being inside a dreams dream. The concept
    and cinematography of the movie is just incredible, especially when Leonardo DiCaprio's character
    shows Elliot pages character how the world bends in the dream.
